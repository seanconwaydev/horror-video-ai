# Open tasks

A resume queue for a fresh session. Each entry is meant to be actionable
without reading the rest of the conversation that produced it. Roughly in
priority order. Neither is decided: 1 is an ADR-sized schema call, and 2
is a diagnosis nobody has run yet. Both come out of the same real run.

Finished entries are deleted rather than ticked off -- git history is the
record. Most recently done: **validating 0054 and 0057 against a real
run** -- occlusion now renders as a physical act (a hand braced on the
pillar being hidden behind) and beat 3 produced the first image the owner
called genuinely acceptable -- plus dropping the duplicate `ACTION:` line
([0057](../decisions/0057-drop-the-duplicate-action-line.md)), deleting
three prompt rules by judgement rather than building the ablation
registry ([0058](../decisions/0058-delete-rules-by-judgement-not-ablation.md)),
broadening the CI trigger to every branch
(which is why five commits had shipped with no CI at all), and splitting
the 2,491-line `cli.py` into `cli/` -- six modules, one seam per commit,
with `app.py` left holding the argument parser and `main()` at 631 lines.
The coverage floor rose from 84 to 86 along the way.

One thing that split surfaced and did not fix: **142 of the repo's 198
uncovered statements are now `main()`**, and `main()` is not untested --
CI's smoke job runs it end to end offline every push. It is just not
*measured*, because coverage only runs under pytest. Running the smoke
job under `coverage run` and combining the two reports would make the
real number visible; nobody has decided whether that is worth doing.

Deeper context lives in [repo-audit-brief.md](./repo-audit-brief.md),
[eval-loop-plan.md](./eval-loop-plan.md) and
[prompt-rule-registry-scope.md](./prompt-rule-registry-scope.md).

## 1. Rewrite beats that depend on distance

Not a code task. Four blind runs established that **distance is not
promptable** -- "does the far figure read as far away" succeeded in 1 image
out of 22, across every authoring style tried, including an explicit
"roughly a twentieth of the image". The owner: "he's never more than ~10
feet in front of her... a parking garage could have him 50-100+ feet away
easily."

[0059](../decisions/0059-blocking-and-size-replace-frame-position.md) fixed
the near field -- whether two characters read as occupying one space in a
believable order -- and explicitly did not fix this. The open question is
what the planner should do instead when a scene wants a figure noticed at
a distance: a different shot (something in the foreground the figure is
small against), a different beat (cut to him rather than seeing him far
off), or simply not writing the beat. Worth deciding before the next horror
run, because the planning rules currently encourage exactly the shot that
cannot be delivered.

## 2. Why is the mood under-delivered when the prompt asks for it twice?

The owner on the 2026-09-18 run: "the shadows and mood should probably be
better for horror, though i didn't check how much of the prompt specified
this." It is specified twice and in detail -- the `horror-comic` preset
asks for "heavy inked black shadows... high contrast between lit and
unlit areas", and each beat's own `lighting` field is concrete chiaroscuro
("one hard pool of white light... the far end of the aisle drops into
unlit black").

So this is not a missing instruction, and writing a 32nd rule would be
the exact move ADR 0058 just argued against. Things worth checking before
anything else: whether the character reference sheet every beat is *edited
from* is washing out the contrast it inherits, whether `LIGHTING` late in
the prompt loses to `STYLE` right after it, and whether the model simply
does not do heavy blacks at this level. The first two are testable with
the eval harness; the third is not fixable here.

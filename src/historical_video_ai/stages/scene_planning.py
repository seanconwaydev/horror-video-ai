"""Scene-planning stage -- inserted between fact-check and previz. See
docs/decisions/0023-scene-planning-stage.md.

Turns a verified fact sheet into a full plan (characters, locations, and
beats) before any image generation happens -- formalizes what was, until
now, done by hand in a chat session for every real multi-beat scene this
project has produced (Agent Voss, the Pompeii influencer scene). Locations
are a distinct concept from beats, not just a flat shot list: see
docs/playbook/video-generation-prompting.md's location-consistency
findings for why. previz doesn't consume this plan's `Location`/`Character`
references yet -- that's docs/decisions/0024.

_PROMPT_TEMPLATE = """\
You are a shot-list planner for a short historical video scene. Break the \
scene below into a full plan BEFORE any image gets generated: the \
character(s) involved, the distinct locations the action moves through, \
and the individual beats (shots) that tell the story.

Scene -- Time: {time} | Place: {place} | What happens: {description}

Verified claims about this place (use these to ground locations and \
beats in real detail; some may describe other eras and must not be \
depicted unless they hold at {time} specifically):
{claims_block}
{max_beats_line}
Planning rules:
- A LOCATION is one physical space the action happens in -- if the scene \
visits multiple distinct spaces (e.g. a street, then a building's \
interior), each is its own Location. Describe architecture in physical, \
concrete terms (materials, fixed structures), not aesthetic ones.
- A BEAT is exactly one moment/shot, never more -- do not describe \
multiple sequential actions in one beat's `action` field. Every beat must \
reference a `location_id` matching one of the Locations you define.
- Vary camera framing deliberately per beat rather than defaulting every \
shot to facing the camera -- a character can face away from camera, be \
seen in profile, or be shot from behind, whenever that's the more natural \
choice for what's happening in that beat.
- Also vary the character's body position and what they're physically \
doing across beats -- avoid repeating the same standing position, \
orientation, and pose in consecutive beats at the same location. Give \
each beat a distinct, concrete physical action (reaching, turning, \
stepping, sitting, gesturing) unless stillness is specifically the point \
of that beat. A slightly different look for the character between beats \
(hair catching light differently, a minor pose-driven wardrobe shift) is \
fine and expected -- prioritize dynamic, believable movement over rigid \
visual sameness.
- For a character who doesn't belong to the historical setting (a \
modern-day visitor, time traveler, narrator), describe \
`wardrobe_signature`/`wardrobe_flexible` with specific, concrete, \
contemporary clothing items -- not vague terms like "casual clothes" -- \
so the result actually reads as modern, not historical.
- Any lit screen (a phone, a device) should be described as a subtle, \
realistic light source, clearly weaker than the beat's main light source \
(sun, lamp, sky) -- e.g. "a faint, dim glow on her hands, much weaker \
than the daylight around her," not open-ended "glowing"/"electric glow" \
language, which image models tend to render as an unrealistically bright, \
star-like point light.
- When a beat has a character looking at a handheld or propped screen \
from a camera angle that would naturally hide the screen from camera (an \
over-the-shoulder shot from behind her, a side view, a back view), \
explicitly state in `action` or `camera` that the screen face is NOT \
visible to camera -- we see its back or edge instead. Image models \
default to rendering a screen's face toward the viewer regardless of the \
described geometry unless told the opposite outright.
- `style` should include "photorealistic, no on-screen text/UI/logos" \
unless the scene specifically calls for something else.

this exact shape:
